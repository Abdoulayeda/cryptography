# Cryptography

This repository will slowly get more and more cryptography code samples written in Java. 
Methods are related to Cryptography android app cipher method collection. 
Point of this repository is that users can find everything in one place, modify code, play with these methods 
in any way they want and this way learn how ciphers worked in the past and how they work these days.

This repository is part of this Android application: [Google Play - Cryptography](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitramite.cryptography)


### Installation
1. Download and install eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2. Download project source code by either cloning it with git or by `Clone or download` menu `Download ZIP` option.
2. Open project in Eclipse `File` - `Open projects from File System...`
3. Navigate to `/src` - `cryptography` - `Ciphers.java` and start play with it. Rest of the folder structure
has method specific code and tests files for running automated tests.
